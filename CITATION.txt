If you use PyTSEB in any academic work then you *must* cite the following papers:

Norman, J. M.; Kustas, W. P. & Humes, K. S. Source approach for estimating soil and 
vegetation energy fluxes in observations of directional radiometric surface temperature 
Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 1995, 77, 263-293

Kustas, W. P. & Norman, J. M. Evaluation of soil and vegetation heat flux predictions 
using a simple two-source model with radiometric temperatures for partial canopy cover 
Agricultural and Forest Meteorology, 1999, 94, 13-29

If you use **the Dual-Time Differenced (DTD)** model you *must* also cite the following papers

two source energy balance model with time-differencing to estimate surface energy fluxes with 
day-night MODIS observations Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 2013, 17, 2809-2825
